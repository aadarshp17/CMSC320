Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I am interested in taking CMSC320, Introduction to Data Science, because I want to become a machine learning engineer. 
In order to become a machine learning engineer I need to know how to transform raw/unstructured data into meaningful structured data that can be used to train a ML model.
